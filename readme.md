# **JavaScript30**

Repo for the Javascript30 course from @wesbos.
 
In each exercise I try to improve on the final solution. Below is listed the changes to the final solutions on the course.

**Exercise 2:**
- Added the numbers to the clock
- These were styled and initially positioned with CSS and then rotated into position using JS.

**Exercise 3:**
 - Made the page responsive using flexbox and a media query
 - Used JavaScript to set the initial size of the image depending on the width of the window. 
 - In the same function the image would then be shrunk depending on the padding amount. CSS styling could not be used in this instance as an increase in padding would push the image outside of the window width (on smaller devices).

- Maximum number of elements in key press array is equal to that of key sequence
